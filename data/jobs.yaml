    At my time at Honda, I worked with production and management to make improvements to the manufacturing line for mass production and new models of the Honda Civic. More specifically, I helped better utilize model-specific manpower idle time to produce additional sub-assemblies in the department, lead a new model project in my group from ideation stage to implementation, and developed a sub-assembly inventory model to  improve utilization of manpower and reduce lineside space required for in-house delivery shipments.
