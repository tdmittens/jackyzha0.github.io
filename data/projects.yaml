    Since COVID-19 hit the world by storm, we noticed that many people had begun to use Discord servers as a way of communicating in large clusters. However, many Discord servers run into issues of their members sometimes being negative towards one another, and sometimes that behaviour becomes commonplace. We built a bot that seeks to gamify the experience of providing positivity to one another within any Discord server you use it in. The bot tracks the positivity/'bubbliness' of all members in the server and compiles a leaderboard, assigning the role of 'Bubbliest' to the most positive server member.

    KaraokeBot takes a song and artist name and then plays that song. It then detects if you speaking/singing and starts recording. From there it calculates the accuracy of your vocal pitch and lyrical accuracy with that of the song and artist. Once complete, you will be given a score that you can compare with friends to see who is the most talented.

    With our busy lifestyles, it can be difficult to remember where our most coveted items are & when they need replacing. This problem is amplified for our elderly. We wanted to create a product that could help solve these problems while also having an easy to use interface. This app allows a user to view items in different rooms around the house, modify expiration/replacement dates, and set descriptions to define the location of the items in these rooms. The app is set with a predefined list of items so there is no additional work required on the user's end, meaning this app is ready out of the box.
